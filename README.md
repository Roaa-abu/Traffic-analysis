**Project Goals**
*Implement multiple machine learning models for smoke detection.
*Preprocess and analyze the dataset to handle outliers and scaling.
*Evaluate the performance of models using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
*Provide insights into the best-performing model for this classification task.
**Dataset Details**
*Dataset Name: Smoke Detection IoT Sensor Data
*Source: Kaggle ([smoke_detection_iot.csv](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/deepcontractor/smoke-detection-dataset/data))
*Target: Fire Alarm (indicating smoke presence)
