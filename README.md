### **Project Objectives**  
- Develop and implement multiple **machine learning models** for smoke detection.  
- **Preprocess and analyze** the dataset, addressing outliers and applying scaling techniques.  
- **Evaluate model performance** using key metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.  
- Identify and provide insights into the **best-performing model** for smoke classification.
